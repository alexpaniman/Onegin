THE PROLOGUE

[Enter Chorus.]

 In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
 A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
 Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
 And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which but their children's end naught could remove,
 Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
 Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Two households, both alike in dignity,
Chor.

ACT I

Scene 1

A public place.

[Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.]

Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
Sampson.

No, for then we should be colliers.
Gregory.

I mean, an we be in choler we'll draw.
Sampson.

Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
Gregory.

I strike quickly, being moved.
Sampson.

But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
Gregory.

A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
Sampson.

therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
Gregory.

A dog of that house shall move me to stand:
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
Sampson.

wall.
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
Gregory.

are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
Sampson.

The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
Gregory.

I will cut off their heads.
when I have fought with the men I will be cruel with the maids,
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:
Sampson.

The heads of the maids?
Gregory.

Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.
Sampson.

They must take it in sense that feel it.
Gregory.

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
Sampson.

thou hadst been poor-John. — Draw thy tool;
Here comes two of the house of Montagues.
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst,
Gregory.

My naked weapon is out: quarrel! I will back thee.
Sampson.

How! turn thy back and run?
Gregory.

Fear me not.
Sampson.

No, marry; I fear thee!
Gregory.

Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Sampson.

I will frown as I pass by; and let them take it as they
Gregory.

Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.
Sampson.

[Enter Abraham and Balthasar.]

Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Abraham.

I do bite my thumb, sir.
Sampson.

Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Abraham.

Is the law of our side if I say ay?
Sampson.

No.
Gregory.

No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
thumb, sir.
Sampson.

Do you quarrel, sir?
Gregory.

Quarrel, sir! no, sir.
Abraham.

But if you do, sir, am for you: I serve as good a man as
you.
Sampson.

No better.
Abraham.

Well, sir.
Sampson.

Say better; here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
Gregory.

Yes, better, sir.
Sampson.

You lie.
Abraham.

Draw, if you be men. — Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
Sampson.

[They fight.]

[Enter Benvolio.]

[Beats down their swords.]
Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.
Benvolio.

[Enter Tybalt.]

Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Tybalt.

Or manage it to part these men with me.
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Benvolio.

As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!
What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word
Tybalt.

[They fight.]

Citizens with clubs.]
[Enter several of both Houses, who join the fray; then enter

Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
1 Citizen.

[Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.]

What noise is this? — Give me my long sword, ho!
Capulet.

A crutch, a crutch! — Why call you for a sword?
Lady Capulet.

And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
My sword, I say! — Old Montague is come,
Capulet.

[Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.]

Thou villain Capulet! — Hold me not, let me go.
Montague.

Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
Lady Montague.

[Enter Prince, with Attendants.]

Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel, —
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince. —
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets;
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
For this time, all the rest depart away: —
You, Capulet, shall go along with me; —
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. —
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
With purple fountains issuing from your veins, —
Will they not hear? — What, ho! you men, you beasts,
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Prince.

Citizens, and Servants.]
[Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,

Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? —
Montague.

And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn:
Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
I drew to part them: in the instant came
Here were the servants of your adversary
Benvolio.

Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
O, where is Romeo? — saw you him to-day? —
Lady Montague.

A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
That westward rooteth from the city's side, —
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made; but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own, —
That most are busied when they're most alone, —
Pursu'd my humour, not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
Where, — underneath the grove of sycamore
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Benvolio.

Many a morning hath he there been seen,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs:
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself;
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
Montague.

My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Benvolio.

I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Montague.

Have you importun'd him by any means?
Benvolio.

Both by myself and many other friends;
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself, — I will not say how true, —
But to himself so secret and so close,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
So far from sounding and discovery,
Montague.

I'll know his grievance or be much denied.
See, where he comes: so please you step aside;
Benvolio.

I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. — Come, madam, let's away,
Montague.

[Exeunt Montague and Lady.]

[Enter Romeo.]

Good morrow, cousin.
Benvolio.

Is the day so young?
Romeo.

But new struck nine.
Benvolio.

Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Romeo.

It was. — What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Benvolio.

Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Romeo.

In love?
Benvolio.

Out, —
Romeo.

Of love?
Benvolio.

Out of her favour where I am in love.
Romeo.

Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Benvolio.

Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love: —
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! —
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Where shall we dine? — O me! — What fray was here?
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! —
Romeo.

No, coz, I rather weep.
Benvolio.

Good heart, at what?
Romeo.

At thy good heart's oppression.
Benvolio.

Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast;
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. —
Farewell, my coz.
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Why, such is love's transgression. —
Romeo.

[Going.]

An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Soft! I will go along:
Benvolio.

This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
Romeo.

Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
Benvolio.

What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Romeo.

But sadly tell me who.
Groan! why, no;
Benvolio.

Bid a sick man in sadness make his will, —
Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill! —
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Romeo.

I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
Benvolio.

A right good markman! — And she's fair I love.
Romeo.

A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
Benvolio.

And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
With Cupid's arrow, — she hath Dian's wit;
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
Romeo.

Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Benvolio.

For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She hath forsworn to love; and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
Romeo.

Be rul'd by me, forget to think of her.
Benvolio.

O, teach me how I should forget to think.
Romeo.

Examine other beauties.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Benvolio.

These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
To call hers, exquisite, in question more:
'Tis the way
Romeo.

I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
Benvolio.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 2

A Street.

[Enter Capulet, Paris, and Servant.]

But Montague is bound as well as I,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
Capulet.

Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
Paris.

But saying o'er what I have said before:
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
Capulet.

Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Paris.

And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
Such as I love; and you among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me. — Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
Whose names are written there, [gives a paper] and to them say,
Which, among view of many, mine, being one,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she, —
Capulet.

[Exeunt Capulet and Paris].

It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with
his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here writ,
and can never find what names the writing person
hath here writ. I must to the learned: — in good time!
Servant.Find them out whose names are written here!

[Enter Benvolio and Romeo.]

 One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
 One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
Benvolio.

Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.
Romeo.

For what, I pray thee?
Benvolio.

For your broken shin.
Romeo.

Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Benvolio.

Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Whipp'd and tormented and — God-den, good fellow.
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Romeo.

God gi' go-den. — I pray, sir, can you read?
Servant.

Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Romeo.

Perhaps you have learned it without book:
but I pray, can you read anything you see?
Servant.

Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
Romeo.

Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
Servant.

'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters; the
lady widow of Vitruvio; Signior Placentio and
his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother
daughters; my fair niece Rosaline; Livia; Signior
lively Helena.'
A fair assembly. [Gives back the paper]: whither should they
come?
Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the
Valentine; mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and
Stay, fellow; I can read. [Reads.]
Romeo.

Up.
Servant.

Whither?
Romeo.

To supper; to our house.
Servant.

Whose house?
Romeo.

My master's.
Servant.

Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
Romeo.

Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the great
rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues,
I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!
Servant.

[Exit.]

At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
Benvolio.

 Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, — who, often drown'd, could never die, —
 Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
When the devout religion of mine eye
Romeo.

Herself pois'd with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
Your lady's love against some other maid
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Benvolio.

I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
Romeo.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 3

Room in Capulet's House.

[Enter Lady Capulet, and Nurse.]

Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
Lady Capulet.

Now, by my maidenhea, — at twelve year old, —
I bade her come. — What, lamb! what ladybird! —
God forbid! — where's this girl? — what, Juliet!
Nurse.

[Enter Juliet.]

How now, who calls?
Juliet.

Your mother.
Nurse.

Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Juliet.

I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
We must talk in secret: nurse, come back again;
This is the matter, — Nurse, give leave awhile,
Lady Capulet.

Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
Nurse.

She's not fourteen.
Lady Capulet.

I'll lay fourteen of my teeth, —
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four, —
To Lammas-tide?
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
Nurse.

A fortnight and odd days.
Lady Capulet.

Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
She was too good for me: — but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd, — I never shall forget it — ,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:
Nay, I do bear a brain: — but, as I said,
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband, — God be with his soul!
'A was a merry man, — took up the child:
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay:'
To see now how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
I never should forget it; 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
Susan and she, — God rest all Christian souls! —
Nurse.

Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
Lady Capulet.

To think it should leave crying, and say 'Ay:'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly.
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
Yes, madam; — yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Nurse.

And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
Juliet.

An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd:
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Nurse.

I came to talk of. — Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?
Marry, that marry is the very theme
Lady Capulet.

It is an honour that I dream not of.
Juliet.

An honour! — were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
Nurse.

Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief; —
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
Lady Capulet.

A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world — why he's a man of wax.
Nurse.

Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Lady Capulet.

Nay, he's a flower, in faith, a very flower.
Nurse.

This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea; and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
Lady Capulet.

No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men
Nurse.

Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Lady Capulet.

I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Juliet.

[Enter a Servant.]

Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed
in the pantry, and everything in extremity. I must
hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
Servant.

Juliet, the county stays.
We follow thee. [Exit Servant.] —
Lady Capulet.

Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Nurse.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 4

A Street.

Torch-bearers, and others.]
[Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;

Or shall we on without apology?
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Romeo.

Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But, let them measure us by what they will,
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
The date is out of such prolixity:
Benvolio.

Give me a torch, — I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
Romeo.

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Mercutio.

Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes,
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
Romeo.

And soar with them above a common bound.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
Mercutio.

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
To soar with his light feathers; and so bound,
Romeo.

And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Mercutio.

Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
Romeo.

If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Give me a case to put my visage in: [Putting on a mask.]
A visard for a visard! what care I
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. —
Mercutio.

But every man betake him to his legs.
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
Benvolio.

A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase, —
I'll be a candle-holder and look on, —
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
Romeo.

If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this — sir-reverence — love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. — Come, we burn daylight, ho.
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
Mercutio.

Nay, that's not so.
Romeo.

I mean, sir, in delay
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Mercutio.

And we mean well, in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.
Romeo.

Why, may one ask?
Mercutio.

I dreamt a dream to-night.
Romeo.

And so did I.
Mercutio.

Well, what was yours?
Romeo.

That dreamers often lie.
Mercutio.

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Romeo.

In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs;
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams;
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid:
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight;
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, —
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she, —
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
The traces, of the smallest spider's web;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Mercutio.

Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
Thou talk'st of nothing.
Romeo.

Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
True, I talk of dreams,
Mercutio.

Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Benvolio.

I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
By some vile forfeit of untimely death:
But He that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my sail! — On, lusty gentlemen!
With this night's revels; and expire the term
Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
Romeo.

Strike, drum.
Benvolio.

be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
We cannot be here and there too. — Cheerly, boys;
2 Servant.

[They retire behind.]

[Enter Capulet, &amp;c. with the Guests the Maskers.]

Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you. —
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
I'll swear hath corns; am I come near you now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visard; and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please; — 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
A hall — a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. —
[Music plays, and they dance.]
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. —
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days;
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
You are welcome, gentlemen! — Come, musicians, play.
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, she,
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Capulet.

By'r Lady, thirty years.
2 Capulet.

'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five-and-twenty years; and then we mask'd.
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
Capulet.

His son is thirty.
'Tis more, 'tis more: his son is elder, sir;
2 Capulet.

His son was but a ward two years ago.
Will you tell me that?
Capulet.

Of yonder knight?
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Romeo.

I know not, sir.
Servant.

O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
Romeo.

This, by his voice, should be a Montague. —
Fetch me my rapier, boy: — what, dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
Tybalt.

Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Capulet.

A villain, that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
Tybalt.

Young Romeo, is it?
Capulet.

'Tis he, that villain, Romeo.
Tybalt.

And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him, —
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
Capulet.

It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.
Tybalt.

Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
You'll not endure him! — God shall mend my soul,
What, goodman boy! — I say he shall; — go to;
He shall be endur'd:
Capulet.

Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
Tybalt.

This trick may chance to scathe you, — I know what:
Well said, my hearts! — You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or — More light, more light! — For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What! — cheerly, my hearts.
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time. —
You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed? —
Go to, go to!
Capulet.

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
Tybalt.

[Exit.]

 This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this, —
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
 To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
[To Juliet.] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
Romeo.

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
 And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
 Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
Juliet.

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Romeo.

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Juliet.

O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Romeo.

Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Juliet.

[Kissing her.]
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
Romeo.

Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Juliet.

Give me my sin again.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
Romeo.

You kiss by the book.
Juliet.

Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
Nurse.

What is her mother?
Romeo.

Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house.
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:
I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.
Nurse.

Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
Romeo.

Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
Benvolio.

Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Romeo.

Is it e'en so? why then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good-night. —
More torches here! — Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah [to 2 Capulet], by my fay, it waxes late;
I'll to my rest.
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. —
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
Capulet.

[Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.]

Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Juliet.

The son and heir of old Tiberio.
Nurse.

What's he that now is going out of door?
Juliet.

Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
Nurse.

What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
Juliet.

I know not.
Nurse.

Go ask his name: if he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding-bed.
Juliet.

His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.
Nurse.

Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Juliet.

What's this? What's this?
Nurse.

A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danc'd withal.
Juliet.

[One calls within, 'Juliet.']

Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
Nurse.

[Exeunt.]

[Enter Chorus.]

 And young affection gapes to be his heir;
Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
 Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
 And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
 To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
 To meet her new beloved anywhere:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
 Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
 With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
That fair for which love groan'd for, and would die,
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
Chorus.

[Exit.]

ACT II

Scene 1

An open place adjoining Capulet's Garden.

[Enter Romeo.]

Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
Romeo.

[He climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]

[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]

Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
Benvolio.

He is wise;
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
Mercutio.

Call, good Mercutio.
He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Benvolio.

Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but Love and dove;
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid! —
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. —
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
Young auburn Cupid, he that shot so trim
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Nay, I'll conjure too. —
Mercutio.

An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
Benvolio.

Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it, and conjur'd it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress' name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle,
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
Mercutio.

Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
Benvolio.

If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. —
Come, shall we go?
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Romeo, good night. — I'll to my truckle-bed;
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
Mercutio.

To seek him here that means not to be found.
Go then; for 'tis in vain
Benvolio.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 2

Capulet's Garden.

[Enter Romeo.]

He jests at scars that never felt a wound. —
[Juliet appears above at a window.]
But soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun! —
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. —
It is my lady; O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were! —
She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it. —
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
That birds would sing and think it were not night. —
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!
Would through the airy region stream so bright
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
Romeo.

Ah me!
Juliet.

O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
She speaks: —
Romeo.

Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Juliet.

[Aside.] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Romeo.

Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
Without that title: — Romeo, doff thy name;
What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; —
Juliet.

I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
Romeo.

So stumblest on my counsel?
What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
Juliet.

By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
Romeo.

Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound;
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Juliet.

Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
Romeo.

How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb;
Juliet.

For stony limits cannot hold love out:
And what love can do, that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
Romeo.

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Juliet.

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
And I am proof against their enmity.
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
Romeo.

I would not for the world they saw thee here.
Juliet.

I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Romeo.

By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
Juliet.

By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
Romeo.

Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
Fain would I dwell on form,fain, fain deny
Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say Ay;
And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo: but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,
My true-love passion: therefore pardon me;
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
Juliet.

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops, —
Romeo.

Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
Juliet.

What shall I swear by?
Romeo.

Do not swear at all;
And I'll believe thee.
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Juliet.

If my heart's dear love, —
Romeo.

I have no joy of this contract to-night;
It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
Juliet.

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Romeo.

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Juliet.

The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Romeo.

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.
Juliet.

Would'st thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
Romeo.

But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
I hear some noise within: dear love, adieu! —
[Nurse calls within.]
Anon, good nurse! — Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
The more I have, for both are infinite.
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
Juliet.

[Exit.]

O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
Romeo.

[Enter Juliet above.]

If that thy bent of love be honourable,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world.
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Juliet.

[Within.] Madam!
Nurse.

I come anon. — But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee, —
Juliet.

[Within.] Madam!
Nurse.

By-and-by I come: —
To-morrow will I send.
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief:
Juliet.

So thrive my soul, —
Romeo.

A thousand times good night!
Juliet.

[Exit.]

A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! —
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
Romeo.

[Retirong slowly.]

[Re-enter Juliet, above.]

Hist! Romeo, hist! — O for a falconer's voice
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Juliet.

It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!
Romeo.

Romeo!
Juliet.

My dear?
Romeo.

At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?
Juliet.

At the hour of nine.
Romeo.

I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
Juliet.

Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Romeo.

I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.
Juliet.

And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
Romeo.

And yet no farther than a wanton's bird;
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
Juliet.

I would I were thy bird.
Romeo.

Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Sweet, so would I:
Juliet.

[Exit.]

Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! —
Romeo.

[Exit.]

Scene 3

Friar Lawrence's Cell.

[Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.]

Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
The earth, that's nature's mother, is her tomb;
What is her burying gave, that is her womb:
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find;
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities:
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give;
Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, — grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
Friar.

[Enter Romeo.]

Good morrow, father!
Romeo.

Benedicite!
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprous'd with some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right, —
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? —
Friar.

That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Romeo.

God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
Friar.

I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
Romeo.

That's my good son: but where hast thou been then?
Friar.

I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy;
That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
Within thy help and holy physic lies;
Where, on a sudden, one hath wounded me
Romeo.

Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Friar.

On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when, and where, and how
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.
We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
Romeo.

Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline;
And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then, —
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
So soon forsaken? young men's love, then, lies
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
Holy Saint Francis! what a change is here!
Friar.

Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Romeo.

For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
Friar.

And bad'st me bury love.
Romeo.

To lay one in, another out to have.
Not in a grave
Friar.

I pray thee chide not: she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
Romeo.

But come, young waverer, come go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
O, she knew well
Friar.

O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Romeo.

Wisely, and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Friar.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 4

A Street.

[Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.]

Came he not home to-night?
Where the devil should this Romeo be? —
Mercutio.

Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Benvolio.

Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
Mercutio.

Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
Benvolio.

A challenge, on my life.
Mercutio.

Romeo will answer it.
Benvolio.

Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Mercutio.

Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he

Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabbed with a white
very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft:
and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
Mercutio.

Why, what is Tybalt?
Benvolio.

courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very
butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of
immortal passado! the punto reverso! the hay. —

That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a

Thou hast most kindly hit it.

A most courteous exposition.
Romeo.

Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

Pink for flower.
Romeo.

Right.

Why, then is my pump well-flowered.

'a? — Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the young
Romeo?
Nurse.

I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have
found him than he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of
that name, for fault of a worse.
Romeo.

You say well.

Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; wisely,

What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
Romeo.

I will tell her, sir, — that you do protest: which, as I
take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

Bid her devise some means to come to shrift
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell
Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.

Romeo.

No, truly, sir; not a penny.
Nurse.

Go to; I say you shall.
Romeo.

This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
Nurse.

And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey-wall:
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
Romeo.

Now God in heaven bless thee! — Hark you, sir.

Capulet's Garden.

[Enter Juliet.]

In half an hour she promis'd to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. —
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey; and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, — yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She'd be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. —
O God, she comes!
[Enter Nurse and Peter].
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
Juliet.

Peter, stay at the gate.
Nurse.

[Exit Peter.]

If good, thou sham'st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
Now, good sweet nurse, — O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Juliet.

I am aweary, give me leave awhile; —
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
Nurse.

I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee speak; — good, good nurse, speak.
Juliet.

Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Nurse.

How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
Juliet.

warrant him as gentle as a lamb. — Go thy ways, wench; serve God.-
-What, have you dined at home?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
Nurse.

What says he of our marriage? what of that?
No, no: but all this did I know before.
Juliet.

Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side, — O, my back, my back! —
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
Nurse.

I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Juliet.

And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome;
And, I warrant, a virtuous, — Where is your mother?
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Nurse.

'Where is your mother?'
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, —
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
Where is my mother? — why, she is within;
Juliet.

Are you so hot? marry,come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward,do your messages yourself.
O God's lady dear!
Nurse.

Here's such a coil! — come, what says Romeo?
Juliet.

Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
Nurse.

I have.
Juliet.

Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
Hie you to church; I must another way,
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell;
Nurse.

Hie to high fortune! — honest nurse, farewell.
Juliet.

Friar Lawrence's Cell.

[Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]

That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
Friar.

Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
It is enough I may but call her mine.
Then love-devouring death do what he dare, —
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Romeo.

And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Here comes the lady: — O, so light a foot
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
Which, as they kiss, consume: the sweetest honey
These violent delights have violent ends,
Friar.

[Enter Juliet.]

Good-even to my ghostly confessor.
Juliet.

Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
Friar.

As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
Juliet.

Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
Romeo.

Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
But my true love is grown to such excess,
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
Juliet.

Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
Friar.

out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

Benvolio.

The fee simple! O simple!
Mercutio.

By my head, here come the Capulets.
Benvolio.

By my heel, I care not.
Mercutio.

And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make
it a word and a blow.
Mercutio.

Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Mercutio.

minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords: here's my
Mercutio.

Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Benvolio.

Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Mercutio.

Well, peace be with you, sir. — Here comes my man.
Tybalt.

[Enter Romeo.]

But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him man.
Mercutio.

Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this, — Thou art a villain.
Tybalt.

Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Romeo.

Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
Tybalt.

I do protest I never injur'd thee;
But love thee better than thou canst devise
And so good Capulet, — which name I tender
As dearly as mine own, — be satisfied.
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
Romeo.

Alla stoccata carries it away. [Draws.]
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Mercutio.

What wouldst thou have with me?
Tybalt.

Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I
mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of
his pitcher by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out.
Mercutio.

I am for you. [Drawing.]
Tybalt.

Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
Romeo.

Come, sir, your passado.
Mercutio.

[They fight.]

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. —
Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage! —
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets. —
Hold, Tybalt! — good Mercutio! —

I am hurt; —
A plague o' both your houses! — I am sped. —

What, art thou hurt?
Benvolio.

Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. —
Where is my page? — go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Mercutio.

Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

Romeo.

Help me into some house, Benvolio,
I have it, and soundly too. — Your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me:
Or I shall faint. — A plague o' both your houses!
Mercutio.

[Exit Mercutio and Benvolio.]

My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
Hath been my kinsman. — O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel.
With Tybalt's slander, — Tybalt, that an hour
This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
Romeo.

[Re-enter Benvolio.]

Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
Benvolio.

This but begins the woe others must end.
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
Romeo.

Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Benvolio.

Alive in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven respective lenity,
And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now! —
Romeo.

[Re-enter Tybalt.]

Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again

Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
Tybalt.

This shall determine that.
Romeo.

[They fight; Tybalt falls.]

Stand not amaz'd. The prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. —
Romeo, away, be gone!
Benvolio.

O, I am fortune's fool!
Romeo.

Why dost thou stay?
Benvolio.

[Exit Romeo.]

[Enter Citizens, &amp;c.]

Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?

There lies that Tybalt.
Benvolio.

Up, sir, go with me;
1 Citizen.

and others.]
[Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives,

Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Prince.

There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
O noble prince. I can discover all
Benvolio.

O prince! — O husband! — O, the blood is spill'd
Of my dear kinsman! — Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague. —
O cousin, cousin!
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! —
Lady Capulet.

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Prince.

Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, —
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled:
But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
Your high displeasure. — All this, — uttered
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Benvolio.

He is a kinsman to the Montague,
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true:
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
Lady Capulet.

Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio:
Prince.

His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
Not Romeo, prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
Montague.

And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses,
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
Prince.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 2

A Room in Capulet's House.

[Enter Juliet.]

Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately. —
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night!
That rude eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. —
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. — Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; — come, Romeo; — come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back. —
Come, gentle night; — come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garish sun. —
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it; and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes,
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. —
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such a waggoner
Juliet.

[Enter Nurse, with cords.]

That Romeo bid thee fetch?
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords

Ay, ay, the cords.
Nurse.

[Throws them down.]

Ah me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Juliet.

Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
Alack the day! — he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone! —
Nurse.

Can heaven be so envious?
Juliet.

Who ever would have thought it? — Romeo!
Though heaven cannot. — O Romeo, Romeo! —
Romeo can,
Nurse.

This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but I,
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I.
If he be slain, say I; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
Juliet.

I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, —
God save the mark! — here on his manly breast.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
All in gore-blood; — I swounded at the sight.
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
Nurse.

And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
O, break, my heart! — poor bankrout, break at once!
Juliet.

O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
Nurse.

Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord? —
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Juliet.

Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Nurse.

O God! — did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
Juliet.

It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
Nurse.

Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain! —
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? —
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Juliet.

No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. —
Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae. —
Shame come to Romeo!
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
There's no trust,
Nurse.

Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
Juliet.

Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
Nurse.

Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I, then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But O, it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs, —
Why follow'd not, when she said Tybalt's dead,
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished' — to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead: 'Romeo is banished,' —
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound. —
Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
When I, thy three-hours' wife, have mangled it? —
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Juliet.

Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Nurse.

Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil'd:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords; come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
Juliet.

Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Lawrence' cell.
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Nurse.

And bid him come to take his last farewell.
O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
Juliet.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 3

Friar Lawrence's cell.

[Enter Friar Lawrence.]

Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Friar.

[Enter Romeo.]

Father, what news? what is the prince's doom
That I yet know not?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
Romeo.

Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
Too familiar
Friar.

What less than doomsday is the prince's doom?
Romeo.

A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, —
Not body's death, but body's banishment.
Friar.

Ha, banishment? be merciful, say death;
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death; do not say banishment.
Romeo.

Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Friar.

But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death, — then banished
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
There is no world without Verona walls,
Romeo.

Taking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou see'st it not.
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Friar.

And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven, and may look on her;
But Romeo may not. — More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo: they may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips;
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished, —
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death!
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But banished to kill me; banished?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word banishment?
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat, and dog,
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Romeo.

Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little, —
Friar.

O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
Romeo.

Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
Friar.

Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not, — talk no more.
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy!
Romeo.

O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
Friar.

How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Romeo.

Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Friar.

An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Romeo.

[Knocking within.]

Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
Friar.

Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
Romeo.

[Knocking.]

Thou wilt be taken. — Stay awhile; — Stand up;
Hark, how they knock! — Who's there? — Romeo, arise;
Friar.

[Knocking.]

What simpleness is this. — I come, I come!
Run to my study. — By-and-by! — God's will!

[Knocking.]

Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

I come from Lady Juliet.
[Within.] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;
Nurse.

Welcome then.
Friar.

[Enter Nurse.]

Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Nurse.

There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
Friar.

Just in her case!
O, he is even in my mistress' case, —
Nurse.

Piteous predicament!
O woeful sympathy!
Friar.

Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. —
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:
Nurse.

Nurse!
Romeo.

Ah sir! ah sir! — Well, death's the end of all.
Nurse.

Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
Where is she? and how doth she/ and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
With blood remov'd but little from her own?
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Romeo.

And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
Nurse.

As if that name,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. — O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Romeo.

[Drawing his sword.]

Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art;
The unreasonable fury of a beast;
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz'd me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady, too, that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn, but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Mis-shapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slewest Tybalt; there art thou happy too:
The law, that threaten'd death, becomes thy friend,
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love: —
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But, look, thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. —
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
Romeo is coming.
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
Hold thy desperate hand:
Friar.

My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is! —
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
Nurse.

Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Romeo.

Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
Nurse.

[Exit.]

How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
Romeo.

Either be gone before the watch be set,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late; farewell; good night.
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
Go hence; good night! and here stands all your state:
Friar.

But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief so brief to part with thee:
Farewell.
Romeo.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 4

A Room in Capulet's House.

[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and Paris.]

That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I; well, we were born to die.
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night:
Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
Capulet.

Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
These times of woe afford no tune to woo. —
Paris.

I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
Lady Capulet.

Of my child's love: I think she will be rul'd
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not. —
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next, —
But, soft! what day is this?
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Capulet.

Monday, my lord.
Paris.

She shall be married to this noble earl. —
We'll keep no great ado, — a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
Thursday let it be; — a Thursday, tell her,
Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
Capulet.

My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
Paris.

Go you to Juliet, ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. —
Farewell, my lord. — Light to my chamber, ho! —
Afore me, it is so very very late
That we may call it early by and by. —
Good night.
Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it then. —
Capulet.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 5

Garden.
An open Gallery to Juliet's Chamber, overlooking the

[Enter Romeo and Juliet.]

It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
Juliet.

It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
Romeo.

It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
And light thee on the way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not to be gone.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I:
Juliet.

Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye,
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go. —
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. —
How is't, my soul? let's talk, — it is not day.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Romeo.

It is, it is! — hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
O, now I would they had chang'd voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Juliet.

More light and light, — more dark and dark our woes!
Romeo.

[Enter Nurse.]

Madam!
Nurse.

Nurse?
Juliet.

The day is broke; be wary, look about.
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
Nurse.

[Exit.]

Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
Juliet.

Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
Romeo.

[Descends.]

Art thou gone so? my lord, my love, my friend!
I must hear from thee every day i' the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Juliet.

Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
Romeo.

O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Juliet.

I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
Romeo.

Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
Juliet.

And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
Romeo.

[Exit below.]

If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back.
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
Juliet.

[Within.] Ho, daughter! are you up?
Lady Capulet.

Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Juliet.

[Enter Lady Capulet.]

Why, how now, Juliet?
Lady Capulet.

Madam, I am not well.
Juliet.

Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
Lady Capulet.

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Juliet.

Which you weep for.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Lady Capulet.

Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
Juliet.

As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
Lady Capulet.

What villain, madam?
Juliet.

That same villain Romeo.
Lady Capulet.

God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
Villain and he be many miles asunder. —
Juliet.

That is because the traitor murderer lives.
Lady Capulet.

Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
Juliet.

Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, —
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, —
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Lady Capulet.

Indeed I never shall be satisfied
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him nam'd, — and cannot come to him, —
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
With Romeo till I behold him — dead —
Juliet.

Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
Lady Capulet.

And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
Juliet.

One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expect'st not, nor I look'd not for.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
Lady Capulet.

Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
Juliet.

The County Paris, at St. Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
Lady Capulet.

He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris: — these are news indeed!
Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
Juliet.

Here comes your father: tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.
Lady Capulet.

[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]

But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright. —
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Thy tempest-tossed body. — How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Who, — raging with thy tears and they with them, —
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
Capulet.

Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!
Lady Capulet.

How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her bles'd,
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
Capulet.

But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
Not proud you have; but thankful that you have:
Juliet.

And yet not proud: — mistress minion, you,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
Proud, — and, I thank you, — and I thank you not; —
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
Capulet.

Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
Lady Capulet.

Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
Juliet.

My fingers itch. — Wife, we scarce thought us bles'd
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!
That God had lent us but this only child;
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
Or never after look me in the face:
I tell thee what, — get thee to church o' Thursday,
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
Capulet.

God in heaven bless her! —
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
Nurse.

And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
Capulet.

I speak no treason.
Nurse.

O, God ye good-en!
Capulet.

May not one speak?
Nurse.

For here we need it not.
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Capulet.

You are too hot.
Lady Capulet.

Day, night, hour, time, tide, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's heart would wish a man, —
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer, 'I'll not wed, — I cannot love,
I am too young, — I pray you pardon me:' —
But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die i' the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn.
To have her match'd, and having now provided
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Capulet.

[Exit.]

Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
Juliet.

Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word;
Lady Capulet.

[Exit.]

My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
By leaving earth? — comfort me, counsel me. —
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Some comfort, nurse.
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Upon so soft a subject as myself! —
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
O God! — O nurse! how shall this be prevented?
Juliet.

Faith, here 'tis; Romeo
Is banished; and all the world to nothing
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him; an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
As living here, and you no use of him.
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Nurse.

Speakest thou this from thy heart?
Juliet.

And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.
Nurse.

Amen!
Juliet.

What?
Nurse.

Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeas'd my father, to Lawrence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolv'd.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Juliet.

Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
Nurse.

[Exit.]

Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
So many thousand times? — Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. —
I'll to the friar to know his remedy;
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Juliet.

[Exit.]

ACT IV

Scene 1

Friar Lawrence's Cell.

[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.]

On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
Friar.

My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
Paris.

Uneven is the course; I like it not.
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Friar.

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
And, in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
Paris.

[Aside.] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd. —
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
Friar.

[Enter Juliet.]

Happily met, my lady and my wife!
Paris.

That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
Juliet.

That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
Paris.

What must be shall be.
Juliet.

That's a certain text.
Friar.

Come you to make confession to this father?
Paris.

To answer that, I should confess to you.
Juliet.

Do not deny to him that you love me.
Paris.

I will confess to you that I love him.
Juliet.

So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
Paris.

If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
Juliet.

Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
Paris.

For it was bad enough before their spite.
The tears have got small victory by that;
Juliet.

Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
Paris.

And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
Juliet.

Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
Paris.

It may be so, for it is not mine own. —
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Juliet.

My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. —
Friar.

God shield I should disturb devotion! —
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
Paris.

[Exit.]

Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Juliet.

Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
Friar.

If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empire; arbitrating that
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
Which the commission of thy years and art
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Juliet.

As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
Which craves as desperate an execution
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Friar.

From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Juliet.

Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off:
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes; thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, — as the manner of our country is, —
In thy best robes, uncover'd, on the bier,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
When, presently, through all thy veins shall run
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone,
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow;
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
Friar.

Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
Juliet.

To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Friar.

Farewell, dear father.
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Juliet.

Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
2 Servant.

How canst thou try them so?
Capulet.

Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers:
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
2 Servant.

Go, begone. —
Capulet.

[Exit second Servant.]

What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time. —

Ay, forsooth.
Nurse.

A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
Well, be may chance to do some good on her:
Capulet.

See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Nurse.

[Enter Juliet.]

How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
Capulet.

Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin'd
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
To beg your pardon: — pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Juliet.

I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
Capulet.

I met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
Juliet.

This is as't should be. — Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. —
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.
Why, I am glad on't; this is well, — stand up, —
Capulet.

As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
To help me sort such needful ornaments
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
Juliet.

No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
Lady Capulet.

Go, nurse, go with her. — We'll to church to-morrow.
Capulet.

[Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.]

'Tis now near night.
We shall be short in our provision:
Lady Capulet.

And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; — let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. — What, ho! —
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
Tush, I will stir about,
Capulet.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 3

Juliet's Chamber.

[Enter Juliet and Nurse.]

Ay, those attires are best: — but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
For I have need of many orisons
Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Juliet.

[Enter Lady Capulet.]

What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
Lady Capulet.

As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
Juliet.

Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
Lady Capulet.

[Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]

Farewell! — God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
I'll call them back again to comfort me; —
Nurse! — What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone. —
Come, vial. —
Shall I be married, then, to-morrow morning? —
No, No! — this shall forbid it: — lie thou there. —
What if this mixture do not work at all?
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
Juliet.

[Laying down her dagger.]

Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man: —
I will not entertain so bad a thought. —
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place, —
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort; —
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, — what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad; —
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? —
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: — stay, Tybalt, stay! —
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
Where, for this many hundred years, the bones
What if it be a poison, which the friar

Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
Lady Capulet.

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Nurse.

[Enter Capulet.]

Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
Spare not for cost.
The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock: —
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
Capulet.

Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.
Nurse.

All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
Capulet.

Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
Lady Capulet.

[Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.]

A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood! — Now, fellow,
Capulet.

[Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.]

What's there?

Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
1 Servant.

Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
 — Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Make haste, make haste. [Exit 1 Servant.]
Capulet.

I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
2 Servant.

[Exit.]

The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: — I hear him near.
[Music within.]
Nurse! — wife! — what, ho! — what, nurse, I say!
Thou shalt be logger-head. — Good faith, 'tis day.
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Capulet.

[Re-enter Nurse.]

Make haste, I say.
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
I'll go and chat with Paris: — hie, make haste,
Go, waken Juliet; go and trim her up;

Juliet's Chamber; Juliet on the bed.

[Enter Nurse.]

Mistress! — what, mistress! — Juliet! — fast, I warrant her, she: —
What, not a word? — you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little. — God forgive me!
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake her. — Madam, madam, madam! —
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. — Will it not be?
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you. — lady! lady! lady! —
Alas, alas! — Help, help! My lady's dead! —
O, well-a-day that ever I was born! —
Some aqua-vitae, ho! — my lord! my lady!
Why, love, I say! — madam! sweetheart! — why, bride! —
Why, lamb! — why, lady! — fie, you slug-abed! —
Nurse.

[Enter Lady Capulet.]

What noise is here?
Lady Capulet

O lamentable day!
Nurse.

What is the matter?
Lady Capulet.

Look, look! O heavy day!
Nurse.

Help, help! — call help.
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee! —
O me, O me! — my child, my only life!
Lady Capulet.

[Enter Capulet.]

For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
Capulet.

She's dead, deceas'd, she's dead; alack the day!
Nurse.

Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
Lady Capulet

Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Accursed time! unfortunate old man!
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Ha! let me see her: — out alas! she's cold;
Capulet.

O lamentable day!
Nurse.

O woful time!
Lady Capulet.

Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Capulet.

[Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris, with Musicians.]

Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Friar.

O son, the night before thy wedding day
Hath death lain with thy bride: — there she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die.
And leave him all; life, living, all is death's.
Ready to go, but never to return: —
Capulet.

Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Paris.

Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
Lady Capulet.

Most lamentable day, most woeful day
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woeful day! O woeful day!
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Nurse.

Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! —
O love! O life! — not life, but love in death!
Paris.

To murder, murder our solemnity? —
O child! O child! — my soul, and not my child! —
Dead art thou, dead! — alack, my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried!
Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd! —
Capulet.

In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long:
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church;
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
Your part in her you could not keep from death;
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
Friar.

All things that we ordained festival
Our instruments to melancholy bells;
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.
Turn from their office to black funeral:
Capulet.

And go, Sir Paris; — every one prepare
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
Sir, go you in, — and, madam, go with him; —
Friar.

[Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris, and Friar.]

Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
1 Musician.

Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up;
For well you know this is a pitiful case.
Nurse.

[Exit.]

Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
1 Musician.

[Enter Peter.]

Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease':
O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
Peter.

Why 'Heart's ease'?
1 Musician.

O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
full of woe': O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
Peter.

Not a dump we: 'tis no time to play now.
1 Musician.

You will not then?
Peter.

No.
1 Musician.

I will then give it you soundly.
Peter.

What will you give us?
1 Musician.

No money, on my faith; but the gleek, — I will give you the
minstrel.
Peter.

Then will I give you the serving-creature.
1 Musician.

I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, I'll fa you: do you note
me?
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
Peter.

An you re us and fa us, you note us.

Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

Peter.

ACT V

Scene 1

Mantua. A Street.

[Enter Romeo.]

If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand;
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead, —
And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips,
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
That I reviv'd, and was an emperor.
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think! —
Romeo.

[Enter Balthasar.]

Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
News from Verona! — How now, Balthasar?

Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
Balthasar.

Is it even so? then I defy you, stars! —
And hire post-horses. I will hence to-night.
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
Romeo.

Some misadventure.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Balthasar.

Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
Tush, thou art deceiv'd:
Romeo.

No, my good lord.
Balthasar.

No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Romeo.

[Exit Balthasar.]

Let's see for means; — O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary, —
And hereabouts he dwells, — which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses,
Noting this penury, to myself I said,
An if a man did need a poison now,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house:
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. —
What, ho! apothecary!
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.

[Enter Apothecary.]

Who calls so loud?
Apothecary.

Come hither, man. — I see that thou art poor;
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison; such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
As violently as hasty powder fir'd
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
That the life-weary taker mall fall dead;
Romeo.

Is death to any he that utters them.
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Apothecary.

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back,
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law:
Romeo.

My poverty, but not my will consents.
Apothecary.

I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Romeo.

And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Apothecary.

Doing more murders in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell:
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food and get thyself in flesh. —
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
There is thy gold; worse poison to men's souls,
Romeo.

[Exeunt.]

Scene 2

Friar Lawrence's Cell.

[Enter Friar John.]

Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
Friar John.

[Enter Friar Lawrence.]

Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Friar Lawrence.

Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
One of our order, to associate me,
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
Friar John.

Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
Friar Lawrence.

So fearful were they of infection.
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
I could not send it, — here it is again, —
Friar John.

The letter was not nice, but full of charge
Of dear import; and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell.
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
Friar Lawrence.

Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
Friar John.

[Exit.]

She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come; —
Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake:
Now must I to the monument alone;
Friar Lawrence.

[Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.]

Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof; —
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, —
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, —
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Paris.

[Aside.] I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Page.

[Retires.]

 O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones!
 Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew:
Paris.

[The Page whistles.]

To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
The boy gives warning something doth approach.

[Retires.]

[Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &amp;c.]

Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Is partly to behold my lady's face,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, — a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone: —
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild;
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Romeo.

I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Balthasar.

Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
So shalt thou show me friendship. — Take thou that:
Romeo.

His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
Balthasar.

[Retires.]

Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Romeo.

[Breaking open the door of the monument.]

And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

That murder'd my love's cousin, — with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died, —
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him. —
This is that banish'd haughty Montague
Paris.

[Advances.]

Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee;
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!

I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. —
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence and leave me: — think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. — I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
Stay not, be gone; — live, and hereafter say,
Romeo.

I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
Paris.

Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
Romeo.

[They fight.]

O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
Page.

[Exit.]

O, I am slain! [Falls.] If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Paris.

[Dies.]

In faith, I will. — Let me peruse this face: —
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! —
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? — O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave; —
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Romeo.

[Laying Paris in the monument.]

Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? — O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there. —
O, what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! — Ah, dear Juliet,
That unsubstantial death is amorous;
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
Will I set up my everlasting rest;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. — Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death! —
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love! [Drinks.] — O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. — Thus with a kiss I die.
With worms that are thy chambermaids: O, here
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
How oft when men are at the point of death

[Dies.]

[Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with

Have my old feet stumbled at graves! — Who's there?
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Friar.

Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Balthasar.

Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capels' monument.
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
Friar.

One that you love.
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
Balthasar.

Who is it?
Friar.

Romeo.
Balthasar.

How long hath he been there?
Friar.

Full half an hour.
Balthasar.

Go with me to the vault.
Friar.

And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
I dare not, sir;
Balthasar.

O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
Stay then; I'll go alone: — fear comes upon me;
Friar.

As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
And that my master slew him.
I dreamt my master and another fought,
Balthasar.

Alack, alack! what blood is this which stains
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
The stony entrance of this sepulchre? —
Romeo! [Advances.]
Friar.

[Enters the monument.]

And steep'd in blood? — Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance! — The lady stirs.
Romeo! O, pale! — Who else? what, Paris too?

[Juliet wakes and stirs.]

I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am: — where is my Romeo?
O comfortable friar! where is my lord? —
Juliet.

[Noise within.]

A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents: — come, come away!
And Paris too: — come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet [noise within], — I dare no longer stay.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
I hear some noise. — Lady, come from that nest
Friar.

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. —
Juliet.

[Exit Friar Lawrence.]

Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end: —
O churl! drink all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? — I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
What's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?

[Kisses him.]

Thy lips are warm!

[Within.] Lead, boy: — which way?
1 Watch.

Yea, noise? — Then I'll be brief. — O happy dagger!
Juliet.

[Snatching Romeo's dagger.]

This is thy sheath [stabs herself]; there rest, and let me die.

[Falls on Romeo's body and dies.]

[Enter Watch, with the Page of Paris.]

This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
Page.

The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
1 Watch.

[Exeunt some of the Watch.]

And Juliet bleeding; warm, and newly dead,
Go, tell the prince; — run to the Capulets, —
Raise up the Montagues, — some others search: —
Who here hath lain this two days buried. —
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain; —

[Exeunt others of the Watch.]

But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;

[Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.]

Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
2 Watch.

Hold him in safety till the prince come hither.
1 Watch.

[Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.]

Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps:
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
We took this mattock and this spade from him
3 Watch.

A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
1 Watch.

[Enter the Prince and Attendants.]

That calls our person from our morning's rest?
What misadventure is so early up,
Prince.

[Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, and others.]

What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
Capulet.

Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry, toward our monument.
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Lady Capulet.

What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Prince.

Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.
1 Watch.

Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
Prince.

Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
These dead men's tombs.
With instruments upon them fit to open
1 Watch.

Is empty on the back of Montague, —
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
This dagger hath mista'en, — for, lo, his house
O heaven! — O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
Capulet.

That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
O me! this sight of death is as a bell
Lady Capulet.

[Enter Montague and others.]

Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.
Prince.

Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Montague.

Look, and thou shalt see.
Prince.

To press before thy father to a grave?
O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
Montague.

And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience. —
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Prince.

Doth make against me, of this direful murder;
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Friar.

Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
Prince.

Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce,
To County Paris: — then comes she to me,
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, — some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, — here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and if ought in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Friar.

Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
We still have known thee for a holy man. —
Prince.

And then in post he came from Mantua
This letter he early bid me give his father;
And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not, and left him there.
To this same place, to this same monument.
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
Balthasar.

Give me the letter, — I will look on it. —
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch? —
Prince.

And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by-and-by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
Boy.

Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. —
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: — all are punish'd.
Where be these enemies? — Capulet, — Montague, —
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Prince.

Can I demand.
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
Capulet.

But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
There shall no figure at such rate be set
That while Verona by that name is known,
Montague.

As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
Capulet.

A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
 Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
 The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Prince.

[Exeunt.]
